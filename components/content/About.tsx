        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m{" "}
        <strong className="text-foreground dark:text-white">Martin</strong>, and
        I&apos;ve been passionate about coding since I was a child. I fell in
        love with programming at a young age, spending countless hours learning,
        experimenting, and creating small projects. Over the years, this passion
        has grown into a career as a Full Stack developer, where I continue to
        build innovative solutions that solve real-world problems.

        If youâ€™re interested in collaborating on something exciting or need help
        with a project, feel free to reach out. Letâ€™s create something amazing
        together!
