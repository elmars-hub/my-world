        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m {personalInfo.userName}, a {personalInfo.role}{" "}
        whoâ€™s passionate about building clean, responsive, and user-focused web
        applications. My journey into tech began with a simple curiosity: how do
        the apps and websites we use every day actually work? That question
        sparked a deep interest that quickly turned into a passion for creating
        things on the web from small passion projects to real-world
        applications.
        <br />
        <br />
        Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed a strong foundation in modern frontend
        technologies like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>. I love
        turning designs into functional, pixel-perfect interfaces that feel
        smooth and intuitive to use. Whether it&apos;s a landing page, a
        dashboard, or a full-blown web app, I enjoy the challenge of translating
        ideas into interactive digital experiences.
        <br />
        <br />
        My approach to development is centered around clean code, accessibility,
        performance, and a deep attention to detail. Iâ€™m constantly learning
        keeping up with frontend trends, improving my UI/UX skills, and
        experimenting with new tools and frameworks. I also enjoy collaborating
        with other developers, learning from open-source projects, and
        contributing to team-based work that pushes me to grow.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of coding, Iâ€™m someone who finds a lot of joy and inspiration in
        music and anime. Music is my daily companion whether Iâ€™m listening to
        lo-fi while coding, vibing to R&B, or losing myself in emotional
        soundtracks from shows like Vampire Diaries, Attack on Titan, or Naruto.
        Anime, for me, isnâ€™t just entertainment itâ€™s a huge creative influence
        thatâ€™s shaped the way I see storytelling, emotion, and even design.
        <br />
        <br />
        I believe in building in public, sharing what I learn, and being part of
        a supportive developer community. Whether itâ€™s a hackathon, a side
        project, or just helping others out, I love any chance to connect and
        create. Iâ€™m still growing, still learning, and still building one
        component, one project, and one lesson at a time.
        <br />
        <br />
        If youâ€™re into frontend development, anime, music, or just love creating
        cool things on the web Iâ€™d love to connect. Letâ€™s build something
        amazing together!

        If youâ€™re interested in collaborating on something exciting or need help
        with a project, feel free to reach out. Letâ€™s create something amazing
        together!
